# INSTALLING WINDOWS AND LINUX VM IN UTM

## WINDOWS VM INSTALLATION

**üõ†Ô∏èSETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

1. **INSTALLING THE UTM**
- The UTM application was downloaded from¬†[https://mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app/).
- After the download completed, the application‚Äôs disk image was moved into the Applications folder.

1. **DOWNLOADING THE WINDOWS 11 ARM64 ISO**

There are two main methods of downloading the Windows 11 ARM64 ISO  

- Downloading it from the Crystal Fetch app
- Visiting  [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64) to download .

 Crystal Fetch application was selected due to its faster download speed, whereas downloading from Microsoft required account creation.

- The virtual machine was configured with 8 GB of RAM, 8 CPU cores storage allocation of 64 GB, with all other settings retained at their default values.

1. **STARTING THE VM AND INSTALLING WINDOWS**
- The virtual machine was started, launching the Windows Setup Wizard. The installation proceeded successfully, and the virtual machine was restarted upon completion of the Windows installation process.

**üëæCHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS**

1. **BOOT LOOP**

**Problem:**

During the Windows installation, the virtual machine entered a continuous restart cycle. Investigation revealed that the Windows ISO remained mounted in the CD/DVD drive, causing the VM to boot from it rather than the installed operating system.

**Solution:** 

- The virtual machine was completely shut down.
- The CD/DVD drive settings were adjusted to remove the Windows ISO.
- The hard disk was prioritized in the boot order. Following these adjustments, the VM successfully booted from the installed Windows system.

1. **NO NETWORK CONNECTION**

**Problem:**

After installation, the virtual machine initially lacked internet connectivity. A basic network test using the¬†ping¬†command to google.com returned negative results, confirming the absence of network access. Inspection of the VM settings indicated that network drivers were not properly configured.

**Diagnosis:**

- The latest VirtIO drivers were downloaded from¬†[https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/latest-virtio/](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/latest-virtio/), specifically the¬†virtio-win.iso.

- The ISO was mounted in UTM, and the network driver was installed via the Windows Device Manager.
- After installation of the driver, network connectivity was restored and verified through successful ping responses.

## LINUX VM INSTALLATION

**Ubuntu Virtual Machine Setup in UTM** 

---

1. A new virtual machine was created within UTM.
2. Two virtualization options were available: ‚ÄúVirtualise,‚Äù which supports the native CPU architecture and provides faster performance, and ‚ÄúEmulate,‚Äù which allows other CPU architectures but operates more slowly. The ‚ÄúVirtualise‚Äù option was selected to ensure optimal VM performance.
3. The operating system for the virtual machine was specified as Linux.
4. The next step involved attaching a bootable ISO image. A Linux ISO file was obtained from the official distribution website.
    - Ubuntu Server ISO was downloaded from¬†[https://ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/).

### **Post-Installation Configuration**

- A graphical user interface (GUI) was required for ease of operation. The Ubuntu desktop environment was installed to allow GUI-based interaction, reducing the reliance on command-line operations.
- The installation of the Ubuntu desktop was executed via command-line instructions.
- We can install ubuntu desktop by using the following commands in the command line:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tasksel
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
```

- The system was updated with this command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

- Followed by:

```bash
sudo apt install tasksel
```

- Finally :

```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
```

- The installtion of ubuntu commenced.
- Upon completion, the OS was rebooted with this command:

```bash
sudo reboot now
```

- After rebooting, the graphical user interface appeared.
- Ubuntu should be up and running.
